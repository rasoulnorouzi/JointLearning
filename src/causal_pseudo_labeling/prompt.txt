# Objective

- Analyze the input sentence to determine if it describes a causal relationship.
- If it **is** causal, identify every distinct cause–effect pair.
- If it is **not** causal, state so. Always include the original input sentence in the output.

---

## Definitions

- **Causal Sentence**: A sentence stating that one event/condition (Cause) directly leads to, produces, affects, requires, or results in another event/condition (Effect). Look for words like "leads to," "causes," "results in," "affects," "requires," "because," "due to," "therefore," "producing."
- **Non-Causal Sentence**: Describes association, correlation, co-occurrence, comparison, or sequences without a direct causal link or is a question sentence. Output "causal": no.
- **Cause**: The event or condition that initiates the effect. Extract the exact phrase from the sentence.
- **Effect**: The outcome resulting from the cause. Extract the exact phrase from the sentence.

---

# Causal Requirement Rules

- A requirement is causal if its absence prevents an effect (necessary) and, when present alone, guarantees the effect (sufficient).
- Conversely, if an effect can occur without the requirement, it is non-causal.
- In a statement like "A causes B by/through/because of C," treat C as the initial necessary factor that produces B, which in turn is required for A to occur; each link in the chain should be evaluated for its necessary and sufficient role.
- If replacing "when" with "if" or "because" preserves the meaning of one event triggering another, then "when" signals a causal relationship; if not, it merely marks a temporal sequence.

## Output Format (Required)

You **MUST** output **only** a single JSON object that follows this exact schema. No surrounding words, labels, headers, markdown, or code fences.

**For causal sentences**

```json

{
  "text": "[exact input sentence]",
  "causal": true,
  "relations": [
     {
       "cause": "[exact cause text 1]",
       "effect": "[exact effect text 1]",
       "type": "Rel_CE"
     },
     {
       "cause": "[exact cause text 2]",
       "effect": "[exact effect text 2]",
       "type": "Rel_CE"
     }
     // ... potentially more relations
  ]
}
```

**For non‑causal sentences**

```json
{
  "text": "[exact input sentence]",
  "causal": false,
  "relations": []
}
```

**Constraints**
(See the templates above for structure.)

* `"text"` **must** be the exact input sentence.
* `"causal"` must be the boolean values **true** or **false**.
* `"relations"` must always be a list (`[]`).

  * If `"causal": false`, the list **must** be empty.
  * If `"causal": true`, include one object for **each** distinct cause–effect pair you identify.
* Every object in `"relations"` **must** have the keys `"cause"`, `"effect"`, and `"type"`.
* The values of `"cause"` and `"effect"` **must** be the exact spans from the sentence.
* The value of `"type"` is always the string **`"Rel_CE"`**.
* **Do not** add explanations, comments, keys, or text outside the single JSON object.

## Causal‑Identification Guidelines

1. Read the input sentence carefully. Ignore parenthetical citations like (Author, Year) or page numbers (p.XXX).
2. Determine if the sentence describes at least one causal relationship. Set "causal" to "yes" or "no".
3. If "causal": yes:
    - Identify all distinct cause-effect pairs presented in the sentence.
    - A single cause might have multiple effects. List each effect separately under the same cause.
    - A single effect might have multiple causes. List each cause separately leading to the same effect.
    - A sentence can contain multiple independent cause-effect pairs. List them all.
    - An effect can sometimes become the cause of a subsequent effect (causal chain). List both pairs sequentially.
    - For each pair, extract the exact Cause phrase and the exact Effect phrase from the sentence. Do not modify, shorten, or extend the phrases. This is true for cause spans as well as effect spans.
    - In a statement like "A causes B by/through/because of C," treat C as the initial necessary factor that produces B, which in turn is required for A to occur; each link in the chain should be evaluated for its necessary and sufficient role.
    - If replacing "when" with "if" or "because" preserves the meaning of one event triggering another, then "when" signals a causal relationship; if not, it merely marks a temporal sequence.
    - Determine the type ("Rel_CE") for each pair.
    - Populate the "relations" list with a dictionary ({"cause": "...", "effect": "...", "type": "..."}) for each identified pair.
    - Construct the final JSON object including the "text" key (containing the original input sentence), and the "relations" list.
    - Format the entire output as a single JSON object exactly as shown in the required output format.

4. If "causal": no:
    - Ensure the "relations" list is empty ([]).
    - Construct the final JSON object including the "text" key (containing the original input sentence), the "causal": false key-value pair, and the empty "relations" list.
    - Format the entire output as a single JSON object exactly as shown in the required output format for non-causal sentences.
5. NON-NEGOTIABLE RULE  
    -Keep **only** relations whose `cause` **and** `effect` substrings appear verbatim (case-sensitive) in `text`.  
      - If a draft relation fails this test, DELETE that relation.  
      - If no relations survive, output:
          {"text":"<sentence>", "causal": false, "relations":[]}
