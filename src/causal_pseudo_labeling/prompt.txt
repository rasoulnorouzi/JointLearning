# Objective

Analyze the input sentence to determine if it describes a causal relationship. If it is causal, identify all cause-effect pairs and their polarity. If not causal, state so. Include the original input sentence in the output.

# IMPORTANT: Required Output Format

You MUST strictly adhere to this exact JSON output format. Output ONLY the JSON object.

For causal sentences:


{
  "text": "[exact input sentence]",
  "causal": true,
  "relations": [
     {
       "cause": "[exact cause text 1]",
       "effect": "[exact effect text 1]",
       "polarity": "[Polarity1]"
     },
     {
       "cause": "[exact cause text 2]",
       "effect": "[exact effect text 2]",
       "polarity": "[Polarity2]"
     }
     // ... potentially more relations
  ]
}



For non-causal sentences:


{
  "text": "[exact input sentence]",
  "causal": false,
  "relations": []
}



- The value for "text" MUST be the exact input sentence provided for analysis.

- The value for "causal" MUST be boolean true or false.

- The value for "relations" MUST be a list ([]).

- If "causal" is false, the "relations" list MUST be empty.

- If "causal" is true, the "relations" list should contain one dictionary for each distinct cause-effect pair identified.

- Each dictionary in the "relations" list MUST have the keys "cause", "effect", and "polarity".

- The values for "cause" and "effect" MUST be the exact text spans extracted from the sentence.

- The value for "polarity" MUST be one of: "Positive", "Negative", "Neutral", "Zero".

DO NOT deviate from this format. Do not add explanations, reasoning, comments, or any text outside the single JSON object.

# Definitions

- **Causal Sentence**: A sentence stating that one event/condition (Cause) directly leads to, produces, affects, requires, or results in another event/condition (Effect). Look for words like "leads to," "causes," "results in," "affects," "requires," "because," "due to," "therefore," "producing."
- **Non-Causal Sentence**: Describes association, correlation, co-occurrence, comparison, or sequences without a direct causal link or is a question sentence. Output "causal": no.
- **Cause**: The event or condition that initiates the effect. Extract the exact phrase from the sentence.
- **Effect**: The outcome resulting from the cause. Extract the exact phrase from the sentence.
- **Polarity: The nature of the causal link**:
    - Positive: The cause increases the magnitude, intensity, frequency, or likelihood of the effect (e.g., "leads to more aggressive responses," "more studying leads to higher grades"). It's not just that the effect happens, but that it happens more.
    - Negative: The cause decreases the magnitude, intensity, frequency, or likelihood of the effect (e.g., "reduces errors," "less sleep leads to lower concentration").
    - Neutral: A causal link exists where the cause triggers, enables, requires, affects, or results in the effect occurring, but the direction (increase/decrease) isn't specified or clearly implied relative to a baseline. Conditional requirements ("if A then B is required") often fall here unless B is explicitly stated to increase/decrease. (e.g., "affects the ability," "flipping the switch turns on the light," "if disclosure threatens safety, refusal is required").
    - Zero: The sentence explicitly states a lack of causal connection between a specific cause and effect, often using negation (e.g., "did not cause reactions," "but not the ability to initiate," "can not to increase, " "may not the reason of").

# Causal Requirement Rules

- A requirement is causal if its absence prevents an effect (necessary) and, when present alone, guarantees the effect (sufficient).
- Conversely, if an effect can occur without the requirement, it is non-causal.
- In a statement like "A causes B by/through/because of C," treat C as the initial necessary factor that produces B, which in turn is required for A to occur; each link in the chain should be evaluated for its necessary and sufficient role.
- If replacing "when" with "if" or "because" preserves the meaning of one event triggering another, then "when" signals a causal relationship; if not, it merely marks a temporal sequence.

# Instructions

1. Read the input sentence carefully. Ignore parenthetical citations like (Author, Year) or page numbers (p.XXX).
2. Determine if the sentence describes at least one causal relationship. Set "causal" to "yes" or "no".
3. If "causal": yes:
    - Identify all distinct cause-effect pairs presented in the sentence.
    - A single cause might have multiple effects. List each effect separately under the same cause.
    - A single effect might have multiple causes. List each cause separately leading to the same effect.
    - A sentence can contain multiple independent cause-effect pairs. List them all.
    - An effect can sometimes become the cause of a subsequent effect (causal chain). List both pairs sequentially.
    - For each pair, extract the exact Cause phrase and the exact Effect phrase from the sentence. Do not modify, shorten, or extend the phrases. This is true for cause spans as well as effect spans.
    - Determine the Polarity (Positive, Negative, Neutral, Zero) for each pair based on the definitions above.
    - Populate the "relations" list with a dictionary ({"cause": "...", "effect": "...", "polarity": "..."}) for each identified pair.
    - Construct the final JSON object including the "text" key (containing the original input sentence), and the "relations" list.
    - Format the entire output as a single JSON object exactly as shown in the required output format.

4. If "causal": no:
    - Ensure the "relations" list is empty ([]).
    - Construct the final JSON object including the "text" key (containing the original input sentence), the "causal": false key-value pair, and the empty "relations" list.
    - Format the entire output as a single JSON object exactly as shown in the required output format for non-causal sentences.
